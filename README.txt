    ===========================

Javascript Date Picker (BE) is a fork, created on 30 March 2016, of Chris Hulbert's Javascript Date Picker, available from:

https://github.com/chrishulbert/datepicker

Here is Chris Hulbert's original notice with the software:

  I've been fed up with all the JS calendar date pickers that are out
  there - they're all too complicated, heavy, rely on frameworks that
  I don't want to include, or they're ugly, or have anti-commercial
  licenses, etc etc etc. So here's mine.
