    Javascript Date Picker (BE)
    ===========================

Javascript Date Picker (BE) is a fork, created on 30 March 2016, of Chris Hulbert's Javascript Date Picker, available from:

https://github.com/chrishulbert/datepicker

Here is Chris Hulbert's original notice with the software:

  I've been fed up with all the JS calendar date pickers that are out
  there - they're all too complicated, heavy, rely on frameworks that
  I don't want to include, or they're ugly, or have anti-commercial
  licenses, etc etc etc. So here's mine.
  
  Please see more details at my blog here:

  License
  
  MIT license applies

Javascript Date Picker (BE) will continue to be offered under the same terms as the original, the MIT license. For the avoidance of doubt, the "MIT license" is interpreted to be the OSI version, the same as the "Expat License". For details, see:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License


    Open Iconic Font
    ----------------

A reduced subset of the open source Open Iconic icon font is now included in the package so that the example can show a calendar icon.

The original font is available from:

https://github.com/iconic/open-iconic

The subset font is offered under the same SIL licence as the original.

Note that the subset and the original fonts are incompatible, glyph positions in the font table are different.
